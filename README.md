Deep Learning - Audio & Image Processing

* Hw1- Getting started with Tensorflow 2. Classifying MNIST images using DNN with experimental optimizers and initializers. 
* HW2- Perform Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) and denoise speech files using DNN, 1D CNN, 2D CNN. 
* HW3- CIFAR 10 Data Augementation, Self-Supervised Learning via Pretext Tasks, Speech Denoising Using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) + RNN (GRU/LSTM). 
* HW4- Network Compression Using SVD, Speaker Verification using GRU
* HW5- RNN as a generative model, Variational Autoencoders using CNN to detect poor images of "Seven" by analysing latent dimensions, conditional GAN to generate image
